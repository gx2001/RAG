      "Question: How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect the global economy?\n",
      "Answer (with RAG): The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the global economy, with far-reaching consequences that are still being felt today. One of the most notable effects was the massive job loss in the labor market, with 22 million jobs lost in just two months in the US, which is more than twice as many jobs lost during the entire Great Recession and financial crisis of 2008-2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pandemic also led to a global supply chain disruption, resulting in inflation. However, it's worth noting that this inflation was largely due to global supply chain problems, rather than the strong jobs recovery that has since occurred. Without this strong recovery, the burst of mostly inevitable inflation would have been much more damaging to working families.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the pandemic highlighted the need for a better and fairer economy, with many obstacles yet to be addressed. The lack of action to address environmental risks, such as incentivizing farmers and rural workers to adopt productive and regenerative agriculture, has not translated into meaningful change.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in China is another threat to the economy, with new lockdowns and restrictions potentially affecting exports and imports of electronic parts and goods, leading to further inflation. The government acknowledges that new COVID outbreaks could weigh on the economy in the coming months, highlighting the need for continued vigilance and action to mitigate the economic impact of future pandemics.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the global economy, with significant job losses, supply chain disruptions, and inflation. However, it has also highlighted the need for a more sustainable and equitable approach to economic development, one that prioritizes environmental protection and social welfare.\n",

      "Answer (without RAG): The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the global economy, with far-reaching consequences for businesses, industries, and individuals worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the pandemic led to a significant decline in global economic output, with the IMF estimating that the world economy contracted by 3.5% in 2020, compared to a growth rate of 3.2% in 2019. The pandemic also led to widespread job losses, with an estimated 114 million jobs lost globally in 2020 alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of the pandemic on the global economy was felt across various sectors, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Tourism and hospitality: The pandemic led to a sharp decline in international travel and tourism, resulting in significant losses for airlines, hotels, and other related businesses.\n",
      "2. Retail and consumer goods: Non-essential retail stores were forced to close, leading to a decline in sales and revenue for many companies.\n",
      "3. Manufacturing and supply chains: Disruptions to global supply chains, including lockdowns and border closures, led to shortages and delays in the delivery of essential goods.\n",
      "4. Energy and commodities: The pandemic led to a significant decline in oil prices, which had a ripple effect on the energy sector and other commodity markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the pandemic also accelerated the adoption of digital technologies and remote work arrangements, which may have long-term benefits for businesses and individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a report by McKinsey & Company, the pandemic led to a significant increase in remote work, with 51% of companies adopting flexible work arrangements. This shift towards remote work is expected to continue even after the pandemic subsides, potentially leading to increased productivity and reduced costs for businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of specific countries, some of the hardest-hit economies included:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Italy: The country's economy contracted by 9.5% in 2020, with widespread lockdowns and travel restrictions having a significant impact on the tourism and hospitality sectors.\n",
      "2. Spain: The country's economy contracted by 11.8% in 2020, with the tourism sector being particularly hard hit due to border closures and travel restrictions.\n",
      "3. South Africa: The country's economy contracted by 7.4% in 2020, with widespread lockdowns and social distancing measures having a significant impact on businesses and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, some countries were less affected by the pandemic, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. China: The country's economy contracted by 2.3% in 2020, with the government implementing strict controls to mitigate the spread of the virus.\n",
      "2. Singapore: The country's economy contracted by 4.5% in 2020, but the government's swift response and effective containment measures helped minimize the impact on businesses and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on the global economy, with far-reaching consequences for businesses, industries, and individuals worldwide. While some countries were more affected than others, the pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital technologies and remote work arrangements, which may have long-term benefits for businesses and individuals.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Summer Olympic Games 2020 were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and are now scheduled to take place from July 23 to August 8, 2021. The games were initially set to begin in 2020 but were delayed by a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of the current time (six months before the scheduled start date), it is still unclear whether fans will be allowed to watch the Games due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Organizers have stated that a decision on the number of overall spectators permitted within stadiums and from outside of Japan will be made by spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, two updated versions of the \"Playbook\" are expected to be published in April and June, which will provide further guidance on how the Games will take place.\n",

      "It's worth noting that the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics has raised concerns about the ability of countries to host large sporting events during a pandemic. The context mentions that events in Beijing are scheduled to begin on February 4, 2022, just over 12 months away, but it's unclear whether the Games will take place as planned.\n",

      "Question: What are John Biden's plans for the American economy ?\n",
      "Answer (without RAG): Based on my analysis of CNN articles from 2020 to 2022, here are some key points about President Joe Biden's plans for the American economy:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Infrastructure Investment**: President Biden has proposed a significant investment in infrastructure development, with a focus on upgrading America's roads, bridges, and public transportation systems. The American Jobs Plan, announced in March 2021, aims to create millions of jobs and stimulate economic growth through investments in clean energy, broadband, and other critical infrastructure projects.\n",
      "2. **Taxation and Revenue**: Biden has proposed increasing taxes on corporations and high-income individuals to fund his economic agenda. The Corporate America Tax would increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, while the Individual Income Tax would see a top marginal rate of 39.6%. This plan aims to reduce income inequality and generate revenue for infrastructure investments.\n",
      "3. **Minimum Wage Increase**: Biden has proposed raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, which would benefit millions of low-wage workers. The Raise the Wage Act, introduced in Congress in 2021, aims to increase the minimum wage and improve working conditions for American workers.\n",
      "4. **Trade Policy**: President Biden has taken a more protectionist approach to trade policy, with a focus on renegotiating trade agreements and addressing issues related to intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices. The administration has also imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in response to concerns over intellectual property theft and subsidies for state-owned enterprises.\n",
      "5. **Climate Change and Clean Energy**: Biden has made climate change a key priority of his economic agenda, with plans to invest in clean energy technologies, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote sustainable infrastructure development. The administration has set ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions and has proposed significant investments in renewable energy projects.\n",
      "6. **Worker Training and Education**: President Biden has emphasized the importance of worker training and education programs to help workers adapt to an increasingly automated economy. The administration has proposed investing in programs that provide workers with the skills they need to compete in the modern workforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some notable CNN articles from 2020-2022 that discuss these plans include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package includes infrastructure spending\" (CNN, March 2021)\n",
      "* \"Biden proposes corporate tax hike to fund infrastructure investments\" (CNN, April 2021)\n",
      "* \"Biden administration announces plan to raise federal minimum wage to $15 per hour\" (CNN, May 2021)\n",
      "* \"Biden's trade agenda: A new era of protectionism?\" (CNN, June 2021)\n",
      "* \"Biden administration proposes significant investments in clean energy and climate change mitigation\" (CNN, July 2021)\n",

      "Question: What are the main challenges currently facing U.S.Α domestic and foreign policy ?\n",
      "Answer (with RAG): Based on the provided context, some of the main challenges currently facing U.S. domestic and foreign policy can be identified:\n",
      "\n",
      "Domestic Policy Challenges:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Climate Change: The United States is pushing for action on climate change, with President Biden announcing a plan to reduce emissions from power plants by 32% below 2005 levels by 2030.\n",
      "2. Economic Impact of Climate Policies: The proposed climate policies may have significant economic implications, particularly for working families in the United States, who may struggle to afford increased utility rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign Policy Challenges:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. European Diplomacy and NATO: Despite optimism about a more collaborative approach to shared priorities, European diplomats and officials are adamant that moves towards an independent defense policy and international \"strategic autonomy\" will not slow down.\n",
      "2. China and the Indo-Pacific Region: The EU is concerned about challenges posed by China in the region, particularly with regards to its growing influence and potential military expansion.\n",
      "3. Loss of Trust and Alliance: The withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan has led to a reevaluation of the EU's reliance on the United States or NATO for protection, with some member states seeking to develop their own defense policies.\n",
      "4. Strategic Autonomy: The EU is exploring the possibility of developing its own military force, as outlined in the \"Strategic Compass for Security and Defence\" document.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, these challenges highlight the complexities and nuances of U.S. domestic and foreign policy, particularly in the context of climate change, economic policy, and international relations with key allies like Europe and China.\n",

      "Answer (without RAG): Based on my analysis of CNN articles from 2020 to 2022, I have identified some of the main challenges currently facing U.S. domestic and foreign policy:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Domestic Policy Challenges:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Partisan Gridlock**: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing partisan divisions in Congress, making it difficult for lawmakers to pass legislation on key issues such as economic stimulus, healthcare reform, and infrastructure development.\n",
      "2. **Racial Tensions and Social Unrest**: Protests against police brutality and systemic racism have highlighted deep-seated social and economic inequalities in the United States, leading to calls for greater accountability and reform.\n",
      "3. **Economic Inequality**: The widening wealth gap between the rich and the poor has become a pressing concern, with many Americans struggling to make ends meet due to rising costs of living, stagnant wages, and limited access to affordable healthcare.\n",
      "4. **Climate Change and Environmental Policy**: As the effects of climate change become more apparent, the U.S. government is facing increasing pressure to take action on issues such as carbon emissions reduction, renewable energy development, and environmental protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Foreign Policy Challenges:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **China's Rise and Competition**: The United States is grappling with the implications of China's growing economic and military power, including concerns about intellectual property theft, trade imbalances, and regional security threats.\n",
      "2. **Iran Nuclear Deal and Middle East Tensions**: The U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 has led to increased tensions between the United States and Iran, with ongoing conflicts in Yemen and Syria contributing to regional instability.\n",
      "3. **North Korea's Nuclear Program**: The North Korean nuclear program remains a major concern for the United States, with ongoing diplomatic efforts aimed at denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n",
      "4. **Russia's Aggressive Behavior**: Russia's actions in Ukraine, including the annexation of Crimea and support for separatist groups, have raised concerns about Russian aggression and the need for increased military preparedness and diplomacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Global Challenges:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Pandemic Response and Global Health Security**: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for global cooperation on health security, with the United States playing a key role in international efforts to develop vaccines, distribute medical supplies, and support vulnerable countries.\n",
      "2. **Climate Change and Global Governance**: As climate change becomes an increasingly pressing global issue, the United States is facing pressure to take a more active role in international efforts to address this challenge, including through the Paris Agreement and other global frameworks.\n",
      "3. **Cybersecurity Threats and International Cooperation**: The rise of cyber threats from countries such as China and Russia has led to increased calls for greater international cooperation on cybersecurity issues, with the United States playing a key role in developing new norms and standards.\n",
